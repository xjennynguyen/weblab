                <h2>What Relevant Course Works have I've taken? </h2>
                <p>

                  For my current semester for the Fall of 2024, I am taking many Computer Science/					Mathematics classes to improve my programming skills. Currently, I am learning three new coding languages called R, HTML, and C which are all very interesting. The relevant classes that I am enrolled in are Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Science for the World, Systems Programming, Web Lab, and Introduction to Probability and Statistics. At the end of the semester, I hope to become a more <em> well-rounded</em> programmer.
